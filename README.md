# Data Management Systems - MSc

This project involves the storage, manipulation, restructuring, and analysis of GitHub data, including commits, authors, and source codes, using PyTorch and Tensorflow. Both projects serve as examples of open source software (OSS) development. The primary goal is to enable efficient querying of data in MongoDB and extract insights into collaboration between authors, commit-level activity, and seasonality in OSS projects using PySpark.

## Project Files:

1. **AnalysisReport.pdf:**
   - Complete rationale behind the restructuring steps and proof of improved efficiency.
   - Results of data analysis, including a network graph created using PySpark.

2. **pymongo.ipynb:**
   - Entire code leveraging PyMongo and PySpark to manipulate and query data, providing deeper insights.

## Analyzed JSON Files:

- **gitIssues.json:**
  - JSON file containing GitHub issues data.

- **gitData.json:**
  - JSON file containing GitHub data, including commits and source code information.
